========================= ===Extra info===

when running mergeSort,

it might not seem like it worked(because I removed all my printf functions to print to the screen), but I actually programmed it to the specification of the hw so it prints the contents into the textfile instead.

when running mergeTime,

I print the values to the screen, and also write it to a file
